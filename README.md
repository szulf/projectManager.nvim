# projectManager.nvim
- NeoVim plugin made for managing projects and tasks withing those projects

## Features
- Everything regarding projectManagement
- gonna update this more precisely later, when I fully finish this
- Mostly functional but still misses some small features

## How it works
- projectManager.nvim creates a 'projects.json' file with all your data in the $HOME directory
- this provides an easy way to view your data or move it onto a different device

## Requirements
- idk maybe dkjson, tho not sure if you need that
- and tested with nvim version: 0.9.4

## Plans for the future
- finishing this
