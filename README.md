# projectManager.nvim
- NeoVim plugin made for managing projects and tasks withing those projects

## Features
- STILL WIP, but currently
- creating new projects, viewing them inside a floating window
- and creating and deleting comments and tasks for them

## Usage
- Simply use the 'CreateProject' command with a name for the project as the argument to create a project
- And 'ProjectList' to view all your projects
- Clicking enter on a selected project will show more information about it

## How it works
- projectManager.nvim creates a 'projects.json' file with all your data in the $HOME directory
- this provides an easy way to view your data or move it onto a different device

## Requirements
- idk maybe dkjson, tho not sure if you need that
- and tested with nvim version: 0.9.4

## Plans for the future
- finishing this
